    <h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Nina and I am 29 years old.<br> 
        After spending much of my life working with animals,<br>
        I am looking to make a career change and am currently<br> 
        studying and learning all I can to become a<br> 
        Front End Developer, with an interest in learning<br> 
        Full Stack Development as well. I have always been<br> 
        drawn to the computer and love art, so web development<br>
        feels natural to me. I am looking forward to growing on</br> 
        my journey!<br>
